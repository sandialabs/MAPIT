## Foreword

---

The purpose of this section is to link theory behind material accountancy to specific code implementations in MAPIT. The methods used in MAPIT are often referred to as Near Real Time Accountancy (NRTA). Generally, NRTA seeks to perform statistical testing of material balances to determine if a material balance is indicative of a material loss. This guide is not intended to to be a comprehensive view of NRTA and it's history, rather, this guide aims to succinctly link MAPIT code to the NRTA statistical theory. Users are encouraged to review related literature for a more in-depth study of NRTA, such as the IAEA's Near Real Time Accountancy paper (STR-403).
