:::{note}
An error config for this setup can be found [here](./assets/exercise5/errorConfig.csv). Place this in the /MAPIT/src/ folder (so that it is in the same folder as `MAPIT.py`) which will enable loading the configuration in MAPIT using the `Load Error Config` after pressing the `Select Errors` button.

### Performance

Threshold = 2.1

Values are approximate and may fluctuate to some degree. However, these values were calculated using 250 iterations, which should provide a relatively high level of certainty.
