# MAPIT Reference Manual

Welcome to the reference materials for the Materials Accountancy Performance Indicator Toolkit (MAPIT). These documents describe how to install MAPIT, include a few examples, and document the underlying code and theory.





>##   :construction: MAPIT IS IN BETA :construction:


MAPIT has worked well in internal testing with the included example dataset and with several example `.csv` and `.mat` datasets. However, there may be some unusual edge cases which will cause the tool to fail.

 Further, V&V for MAPIT is ongoing! Users are responsible for performing their own due diligence to ensure results make sense.

> :warning: You may notice various bugs and errors. Help contribute to this project by reporting them through our issue page.

> :warning: Take care when using MAPIT to perform calculations with many iterations. MAPIT uses single precision to help reduce memory footprint, however, arrays consisting of 100s of iterations can take multiple GBs of data.
